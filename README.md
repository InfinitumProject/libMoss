# MossLibrary

## This library is designed for the projects Infinitum and Quill
Some facets may be useful to others outside of these projects, feel free to use it where applicable.

Please note:
I (Universal82) and the other collaborators are making this library in order to bring intuitive functionality to C++ in multiple areas of our projects. I am not a professional and neither is anybody else here at the current time of writing. While I cannot speak for my colleagues I do want to say one thing: I will accept feedback, but I will not accept unhelpful feedback. If you don't like how I do it then fork, fix it, and submit a pull request.
